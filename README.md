#  Swarm Intelligence Simulation

A Python simulation of swarm intelligence using simple agent-based behavior and pheromone trails. Inspired by ant colony optimization, this project demonstrates how decentralized agents (bots) can collectively search for targets by laying and following pheromones on a grid.

##  Features

* Grid-based environment with randomly placed targets.
* Multiple swarm agents ("ants") searching for targets.
* Pheromone-based navigation with probabilistic pathfinding.
* Pheromone decay over time.
* Visualization using Pygame.

##  Concepts

* **Swarm Intelligence**: Collective behavior from simple agents.
* **Pheromone Trail**: Agents leave virtual pheromones on visited cells.
* **Probabilistic Movement**: Agents prefer paths with stronger pheromones.
* **Exploration & Exploitation**: Balance between discovering new paths and following existing ones.
* **Emergence**: Global intelligence emerges from local interactions.

##  Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pygame (for visualization)
* NumPy (optional, for optimized calculations)
